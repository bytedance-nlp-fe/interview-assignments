# interview-assignments

To start the app, try
```
cd interview-assignments
cd demo
npm install
npm start
```

While the majority of the functionalities are fullfilled, there are still few not fully comstructed due to time limits; it has been a very busy final week with tons of assignment :(

For future references, the potential updates are:
1. Use different logos for various brands instead of relying solely on Twitter's logo.
2. Adjust the width and height of each dropdown menu for a more visually appealing appearance.
